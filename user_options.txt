User options for the genomic simulation program are collected in this text file.
For the time being, user friendliness is does not have a high priority!!
I am keeping the first 10 lines for comments.
All values are going to be read from column 1 (to 10) and treated as INTEGER.
Let the "option" descriptions start at column 11.




#####     MAKE SURE THIS IS LINE 10     #####
800                Number of   males in the base population
800                Number of females in the base population
75,150             Number of   males in breed step
75,150             Number of females in breed step
29                  Number of chromosomes
1000               Number of linkage groups
50000              Number of generations for base data
30                 Number of generations for breed data (if not pedigree)
1                  Number of (expected) recombinations per chromosome
4                  -log(10) of the mutation rate for SNPs
4,0.3              (HIGH,LOW) Proportion of (total) SNPs assigned to be QTL.
0.1,0.25,0.4       (3) heritabilities of the simulated traits.
0.5,-1             (2) Gcorr of traits ( A-->B, A-->C). Gcorr B-->C = 0
2                  Write genotypes: 1 for haplotypes, 2 for genotypes, any other number for no.
30                 # of (last) breed generations to be written (for non pedigree pops)
0                  # of (last) animals to be written (for pedigree pops - Use "0" if you want them all)
2                  Number of breeds to be analyzed 
H1_A,H1_C          Type of selection for each (NONPEDIGREE) breed ([H/L][1/2/3]_[A/B/C] for Nqtl>Me(H) or Nqtl<Me(L), 1/2/3 h2 and trait group A/B/C (or X/Y/Z).
30,30,100,100    Proportions of males (Nbreed) and females (Nbreed)
2                  Number of populations with real pedigree (add namefiles in the lines below (as many as populations)!)
pedigree_bruSEXGEN.txt,pedigree_priSEXGEN.txt  Name of pedigree (if more than 1 pop, please separate name files with commas)
1                  Distribution of QTL effects (1 for ~N, 2 for ~gamma). If gamma add a line with SHAPE param
0.4                Shape for gamma (if Distribution==2)
